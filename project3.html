    <h2>Soldering Project</h2>
    <p>
        Before beginning this project, I had never heard of or seen soldering. I was excited and anxious to learn. In the first class, I was very shaky and had a lot of difficulty soldering, but by the next class, I had become confident in my soldering ability and flew through the process.

        Unfortunately, during the soldering, I accidentally soldered a component that was meant to be attached to another component. I was worried that the clock wouldnâ€™t work since that piece was sensitive to heat. This left me with an additional piece which I ended up not using.
