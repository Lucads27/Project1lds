    <h1>Project 2 Remixing 3D Designs</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project was to learn how to remix 3D files into new 3D prints, using two CAD tools: one being Tinkercad, the other being Autodesk Fusion.</p>

    <h2>Part One: Tinkercad</h2>
    <p>I thought long and hard about what I wanted to make and combine. I knew I wanted a phone holder but wasn't sure how to make it a remix. My original idea was to make a phone holder that also held a water bottle, however, that proved to be too challenging, and the print was going to take too long. So I decided to instead make a phone holder that had a bear which would help support the print and give the phone holder more personality. I did this by finding existing prints and aligning them together so that the remix would be one piece.</p>

    <p>The print took over 10 hours, and I was really happy with how the remix came out. It took me around 15 minutes to remove all the supports, which I did by hand, and it was actually an enjoyable process. Here's me enjoying my print.</p>
