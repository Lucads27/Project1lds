                    <h2>Part 1: Creating my Alarm Clock</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before beginning this project, I had never heard of or seen soldering. I was excited and anxious to learn. In the first class, I was very shaky and had a lot of difficulty soldering, but by the next class, I had become confident in my soldering ability and flew through the process.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, during the soldering, I accidentally soldered a component that was meant to be attached to another component. I was worried that the clock wouldnâ€™t work since that piece was sensitive to heat. This left me with an additional piece which I ended up not using.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fortunately, the clock still worked with the missing piece, and it gave me a unique opportunity to make a different design since my dimensions were different from everybody else's.

                    <!-- Part 2: 3D Printed Enclosure -->
                    <h2>Part 2: 3D Printed Enclosure</h2>
                    <p>
                        It took me a little while to begin my 3D printed enclosure as I was unsure of what design to make. I knew from mistakes on previous projects to measure as accurately as possible. My measurements were width (48mm) and length (60mm) of the battery pack, and height of the battery pack and clock combined (29mm). Throughout this process, I rounded up by 1mm to ensure the enclosure would not be too small. I then began laying out a sketch in Fusion 360, where I used my measurements and increased them by 1mm to guarantee a good fit. In the end, this was my first Fusion design and printed enclosure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I liked the first design and it was functional, I knew I could make significant improvements. So I switched the design so that instead of the piece going in at the top, the base would have holes for the clock. I also made it thicker as I thought that would make for a more durable design. Additionally, I made the closing piece have a notch so that it was easy to put in and remove the 2 components.

                    <!-- Additional Conclusion -->
                    <p>I thought this design was better and more functional, which made me very happy.</p>

                    <h2>Part 3: Creating Laser Cut Enclosure</h2>
                    <p>
                        To begin the laser cut, I took my existing measurements and applied them to a sketch. Learning how to create a laser cut design initially seemed difficult. However, after watching the YouTube tutorial, it was not as hard as I imagined. One difficulty I had was my design choice. Eventually, I decided to go with something similar to my first 3D print. I then completed my design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once I was ready, I laser cut my piece with the help of our TA, who guided me through the process of laser cutting, such as laying out the pieces. Once my piece was laser cut, I realized I had to glue it together because otherwise, it would fall apart. I was very happy with my final product.
