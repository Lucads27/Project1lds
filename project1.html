                       <h2>Part 1: Nametag</h2>
                       <p>This Nametag 3D print was my first 3D print ever, so I made some mistakes. On my first attempt at printing this nametag, after the first color was complete, I didn't insert the filament correctly, which caused my print to fail.</p>
                       <p>So I reprinted the first layer and received some help on the second layer where the filament change was necessary.</p>

                       <h2>Part 2: Fail</h2>
                       <h3>Pre-Printing Process</h3>
                       <p>For the second part of the assignment, I had to find a print that would fail. The hardest part was finding a print that would fail in a way I could learn from. I had 2 initial attempts that failed immediately, so I was told to choose one that would fail at the right time.</p>
                       <p>I did this by choosing something that would fail at the top because of gravity, so I chose an Egyptian god with a protruding nose. I knew for sure that this would fail and gravity in this case would be my friend.</p>
                       <h3>Printing Process</h3>
                       <p>Here the design failed exactly where the nose was protruding, and since there were no supports, the design failed. However, I was still very impressed with the upper part of the nose, which held together really well.</p>
