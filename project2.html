            <h2>Part One: Tinkercad</h2>

            <p style="width:65%; margin: 0 auto;">
              I thought long and hard on what I wanted to make and combine. I knew I wanted a phone holder but wasn't sure how to make it a remix. My original idea was to make a phone holder holding a water bottle. However, that proved to be too challenging, and the print was going to take too long. So I decided to instead make a phone holder that had a bear, which would help support the print and make the phone holder have more personality. I did this by finding existing prints and aligning them so the remix would be one piece.
            </p>
            
            <img src="assets/bear.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; border: 2px solid #ccc;" />
            <img src="assets/sketch.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; border: 2px solid #ccc;" />

            <p style="width:65%; margin: 0 auto;">
              The print took over 10 hours and I was really happy with how the remix came out. It took me around 15 minutes to remove all the supports (by hand!) and, weirdly enough, it was a pretty fun process. Here's me enjoying my awesome print.

            <h2>Part 2: Autodesk Fusion</h2>
            <p style="width:65%; margin: 0 auto;">The barrier to entry for autodesk fusion is much higher than tinkercad. I watched the 90 minute tutorial and while working on my remix used youtube as a resource to assist me. Autodesk fusion, while being harder to learn at first, has so many more features than tinkercad. For this part I had the option to replicate my design or design a new remix. I decided to design a new remix. I wanted to make a pen holder so I combined a dog with a hat penholder. Using autodesk fusion I remixed this dog pen holder design. A tool that helped me alot was the measure tool as it allowed me to see if the pen holder would actually hold a pen.
